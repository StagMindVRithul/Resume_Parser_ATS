## Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment**

Open the terminal in VS Code and run:
```
conda create -p venv python==3.10 -y
  ```
2. **Activate the virtual environment**

    After the environment is created, activate it by running:
    ```
    conda activate venv/
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**

    Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file with all necessary dependencies listed. Then run:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install poppler for `pdf2image`**

    The `pdf2image` library requires an additional dependency called `poppler`. Download it from [here](http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/) and add it to your system PATH.

5. **Set up your GEMINI API key**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your GEMINI API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    ```

### Running the Program
